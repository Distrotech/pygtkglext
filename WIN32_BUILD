	SOME BASIC INSTRUCTION ON HOW TO BUILD USING DISTUTIL FEATURE OF PYTHON ON WIN32
===========================================================================================

NOTE: I'm assuming you've got all the dependencies properly installed.

1)	Generate the setup.py script from setup.py.in by running configure and so on.
	If you can't run configure, you can just manually replace the half dozen or so
	macros with their values in setup.py.in file and save it back as setup.py. All
	these macros are infact just version numbers, so it's not that hard and
	setup.py.in is	pretty small anyway.

2)	Once you've got the setup.py script you can use python to compile and build
	the whole extension module from scratch without needing to use the usual
	make. Just type the following,

	>> python setup.py build --compiler=your_compiler

	So just specify whichever compiler you have that Python supports. For example
	I have Mingw32 on windows. So I type,

	>> python setup.py build --compiler=mingw32

	The default is MSVC (the cl command) when the --compiler flag is missing.

3)	You can build a handy binary installer automatically by typing the following,

	>> python setup.py bdist_wininst

	This will create an installer and place it under the dist directory. It's really
	handy since it's a native windows installer and runs on any windows.
